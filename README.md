 The primary thing of this design is to develop a simulator that allows users to understand and visualize how different CPU scheduling algorithms operate. By simulating these algorithms, users can gain perception into their performance characteristics, similar as effectiveness and responsiveness. The design aims to produce an educational tool that can be used in academic settings or by individualities interested in computer knowledge concepts. 
 
 Expected conclusions 
	A completely functional operation that allows users to input process details( arrival times, burst times, and priorities). 
	Real- time visualizations of the scheduling process through Gantt charts, which will help users see how processes are executed over time. 
	-computation and display of performance criteria , including average waiting time and average turnaround time, which are critical for assessing the effectiveness of scheduling algorithms. 
 
 range 
 The design will concentrate on four essential CPU scheduling algorithms 
 1. First- Come- First- Serve( FCFS) Processes are executed in the order they arrive. 
 2. Shortest Job First( SJF) The process with the lowest burst time is executed next.
 3. Shortest Remaining Time First(SRTF) The process with smallest remaining time will be executed first
 3. Round Robin( RR) Each process is given a fixed time slice( amount) in a cyclic order. 
 4. Priority Scheduling Processes are executed based on their priority situations. 
 
 The operation will allow users to input multiple processes and visualize the scheduling in real- time.
